The aim is to eliminate any manual copying and pasting to produce output that can be used by the journals' compilers.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The main command will analyse a supplied directory for a LaTeX project and create a new submission folder with the modified files. The package does not modify any existing files in the directory. SubmitPaper.jl assumes a LaTeX project directory structure with a main.tex file (main could be something else) which contains a \\documentclass line as well as a \\begin{document} line. The package will search for these root files within a specified directory. It will then look for any \\input or \\include commands in the .tex file and replace them with the actual contents of the corresponding file. Additionally, any figures referenced by the \\includegraphics command will have the path modified to point at the file name of the figure and copy the original figure into the submission directory.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Requirements","page":"Home","title":"Requirements","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"A LaTeX distribution must be installed on the system.\nlatexmk (an automatic LaTeX compiler) is essential as it is used for compilation.

This will find the root document and merge all embedded (via \\input/\\include) tex files into a single  file. Changes all figure references (via \\includegraphics) to remove all nested directories and just point at the filename. Copies all figures from referenced  locations into the submission_dir, removing all nested folders. Writes the merged  file into the submission_dir. Then compiles the newly merged code using latexmk, and cleans up afterwards, leaving the .bbl file behind.\n\nOptional Keyword Arguments:\n\nsubmission_dir: By default is set to directory/submission. This is the folder where submission files are copied. DO NOT set this to be equal to directory.\nforce_overwrite: Deletes all existing files in the submission_dir without asking.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
